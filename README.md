# keystrokes

I wrote this because I wanted to add keyboard support to WebApps before they were even called WebApps. I wanted to use it for games and apps so I could easily add keyboard support, but also the user could choose his prefered keybindings.
This code was written when IE6 was the major browser, surprisingly it still works on modern browsers.
